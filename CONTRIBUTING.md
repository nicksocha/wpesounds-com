## Our Standards

### Add a new sound:

> **_Step 1_**
>
> - [ ] Verify you clip is safe for work, family friendly, and non political.
> - [ ] Record your new sound in the .wav format using your software of choice. We recommend [Audacity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)>) if you currently do not have software to record audio as it is free.
> - [ ] Name your new audio file using Kebab Case `looks-like-this.wav`.
> - [ ] Copy your new audio file to the sounds folder.

> **_Step 2_**
>
> - [ ] Duplicate code below entering the new information between the brackets and removing all the brackets \[ \].
>
> - [ ] New code should be located in the `index.html` file within the `<!-- Main Section -->` in no special order.
>
> ```html
> <!-- [SOUND NAME] -->
> <div class="key" id="[KEYBOARD KEY]" onClick="clickHandler('[KEYBOARD KEY]')">
>   <kbd>[KEYBOARD KEY]</kbd>[SOUND NAME]
> </div>
> ```
>
> **_Example_**: below is the code for a sound named Nick and uses the N key on the keyboard.
> ![Nick Example](https://github.com/nicksocha/wpesounds-com/blob/master/images/nick-example.jpg?raw=true)

> **_Step 3_**
>
> - [ ] Duplicate code below entering the new information between the brackets and removing all the brackets \[ \].
> - [ ] New code should be located in the `index.html` file within the `<!-- Audio Data Attributes Section -->` in the same order as the sounds are in the `<!-- Main Section -->`.
>
> ```html
> <audio data-key="[KEYBOARD KEY]" src="sounds/[AUDIO FILE NAME].wav"></audio>
> ```
>
> **_Example_**: below is the code for a sound named Nick that uses the N key on the keyboard and has an audio file named nick.wav located in the sounds folder.
> ![Nick Sound Example](https://github.com/nicksocha/wpesounds-com/blob/master/images/nick-sound-example.jpg?raw=true)

### Update README:

> - [ ] Duplicate code below entering the new information between the brackets and removing one set of brackets \[ \].
>

> ```
