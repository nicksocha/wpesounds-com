#### [WPE sounds.com](https://wpesounds.com) is a site I built for WP Elevation members to have some fun with.

Inspiration came from [JavaScript Drum Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego) from Wes Bos' [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course. Check out that code on [GitHub](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) as well.
